# Unit3_FinalProject
 <h2>This is my final project for Creative Coding I.</h2>


<h3>Description:</h3>

My final project is "Ready, Set, Rock!" It is a control based game. In the game, the player has a guitar which has four sections, each representing a different chord. In the programme, the player gets to choose beween electric and acoustic guitar. After choosing that they get two more options for the style of music. For example, if they choose electric guitar, their choices are metallic and regular. After they choose a genre, circles with the names of chords will fall on the screen and the player has to press the button on the guitar which represents that chord. If they miss three circles, the screen goes red, plays a noise and says "Game Over". If they finish the game succesfully, then the screen shows a picture of a trophy. 

<h3>Interaction:<h3>

<h4>The user is able to acutally play the songs since they have a guitar with them. They get a proper experience and have the fun of the game and the competitiveness. This game will also help users learn about the different genres in music and what they sound like. They get the expreience of playing the guitar without actually playing it!</h4>
